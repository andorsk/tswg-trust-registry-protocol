# Profile Registry

The `profiles` section serves as a community resource for TRQP-based profiles. While it is not mandatory to host
profiles here, this registry is intended to:

- Provide a place to collect of example profiles for reference and learning.
- Support the community by facilitating the discovery and understanding of profile structures.

This registry is a tool for educational and exploratory purposes, not a required hosting location for profiles.

## To Add A Profile

Submit a PR with the name of the profile as the directory name. 

Use snake case for the name.
